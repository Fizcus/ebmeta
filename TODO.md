* Handle PDF files
  * Determine what metadata may be edited with ebook-meta and write
    reading/writing wrapper code
  * Can arbitrary attachments (self-backup) be embedded in PDF?
  * If not, use "FILE.pdf.original" as backup
* Handle Mobipocket files
  * Can't seem to figure out what archiving wrapper is used
  * Maybe backup like PDFs noted above
  * Rely on ebook-meta for reading as well as writing
